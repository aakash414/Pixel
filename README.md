## Idea
Our project aims to empower small shopkeepers by enabling them to collectively purchase goods in bulk from suppliers through blockchain technology. By leveraging collective pooling, we facilitate cost-effective transactions, fostering growth within the retail industry.
## Features 
1. Collective Pooling: Allows small shopkeepers to pool their funds together to purchase goods directly from suppliers in bulk, overcoming financial barriers.
2. Blockchain Integration: Utilizes blockchain technology (Solidity for smart contracts) within the Ethereum Polygon network for secure and transparent transactions.
3. Community Chat: Facilitates communication between shopkeepers to discuss purchases, share insights, and build relationships.
4. Order Management: Streamlines the ordering process and ensures secure payment transactions for efficient business operations.
